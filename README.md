This package is a unofficial companion to the textbook "Applied Regression
Analysis" by N.R. Draper and H. Smith (3rd ed.).

It includes all the datasets used in the book, both for easy
reproducibility (assuming a didactic point of view) and algorithms
benchmarking purposes.

Dataset names are prefixed by 'ds' and lowercased; furthermore '-' and '.' are
replaced by '_'.  Finally variables have lower-case name.
